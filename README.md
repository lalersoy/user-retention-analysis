# Predicting User Retention in a Healthcare SaaS  

## Overview

This project simulates and analyzes behavioral data from a fictional healthcare SaaS product.

This SaaS app helps users manage chronic conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes) by enabling them to:
- Log health metrics
- Set personal health goals
- View progress dashboards
- Access educational resources
- Book consultations with medical professionals

## Research Question

> “Which user behaviors in the first 7 days best predict long-term retention?”

---

## Objectives

- Simulate a realistic event log for thousands of users over a 45-day period
- Define and calculate key product metrics (D7 and D30 retention)
- Build behavior-based features from first-week usage
- Visualize differences in behavior between retained and churned users
- Provide actionable recommendations for product improvement
